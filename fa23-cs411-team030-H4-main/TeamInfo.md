## Project Summary

Our project aims to raise awareness from people of the air quality in different cities in the United States by providing functionalities for searching and looking into details of the pollution situation of varied cities. Also, we want to hear from our users and thus provide an online forum functionality for them to comment on the air quality of each city.
